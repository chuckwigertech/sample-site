        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Education opportunity for each child is key to their future success. Our economy
          and democracy thrives on quality schools. That’s why our state constitution underscores the importance of
          education and the largest part of our state budget invests in schools. </p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The pandemic has significantly impacted students, families and school staff. We
          need to further review this and provide needed resources. Increased demand for mental health services,
          counseling and protection equipment are among the needs. Federal assistance is needed, too.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Affordable postsecondary education is also a high priority. I’m very proud to
          have Century College in my district. I work closely with the school to encourage and provide opportunities.
          Northeast Metro 916 has many career and technical programs plus other specialized training. Labor-business
          apprentice training programs continue to grow and provide great opportunities. Whether it be the University of
          Minnesota, our state university or private college programs, or military career training, opportunities abound
          to train or retrain people for our workforce. Our economic future is directly linked to the success in these
          various programs and opportunities.

          It’s crucial to protect our families and environment from harmful chemicals. Minnesota is the first state to
          ban TCE (trichloroethylene). I was the Senate chief author of the proposal recommended by the state’s

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          When the State of Minnesota settled its lawsuit against 3M for contaminating our drinking water with
          chemicals, I advocated that funds be provided to our communities to safeguard access to clean, safe drinking
          water. The settlement funds will exclusively fund drinking water and natural resource projects in East Metro
          communities affected by the contamination.


        </p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          Climate pollution creates inequities in our communities of color and under-resourced communities. I support
          requiring companies to notify residents and consumers of environmental hazards, removing harmful carcinogens
          and toxins from our food packaging and furniture, and requiring industrial facililities to comply with clean
          water standards.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">

          I’m proud to be a part of the Senate DFL’s Clean Energy and Climate Caucus. Investing in clean energy and
          green infrastructure helps us be good stewards of our planet and creates great jobs.</p>

          coverage if they have a pre-existing condition.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          I will continue to advocate proposals addressing health care access and affordability, reducing the cost of
          prescription drugs and increasing telemedicine options. These measures are vital to the health and prosperity
          of our families and communities. As our area’s former state senator and senate president, Jerry Hughes, use to
