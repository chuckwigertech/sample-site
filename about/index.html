        </h1>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">I’m a lifelong resident of the district and reside in Maplewood. I graduated
          from North High,
          Hamline University (JD, BA) and the University of Colorado, Boulder, Institute for Organization
          Management. I’m an attorney and recently retired from Securian (law/compliance). I previously
          worked in government affairs for the St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce, and also managed
          several east metro community chambers.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">I have been actively involved in public service and community for most of my
          adult life: chaired the school
          board in district 622 (No. St. Paul-Maplewood-Oakdale) and the Ramsey Soil and Water Conservation District. I
          also served on the Metropolitan Council.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">As a state senator, I have chaired the education policy and finance committees,
          and the election committee,
          plus the senate legislative delegations for Ramsey and Washington Counties, and St. Paul. I work hard and
          thoughtfully. I have earned numerous Legislator of the Year awards and recognition from groups representing
          our schools, the environment, social justice, labor, business and health care.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">I have five children and five grandchildren, and we enjoy the outdoors. I
          coached youth athletics for 25
          years and served on the parish council for church.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Recognizing the ongoing impact of COVID-19, my top priority is reopening and
          economic recovery. Jobs, education and health care are three crucial areas, as well as our environment.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Legislators need to actively listen to business, labor, education, nonprofits
          and other stakeholders as we navigate through the pandemic. By listening, we learn, and then we need to lead
          and take action that reflects recommendations. Working together.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">In education, our goal for E-12 is to graduate the “World’s Best Workforce” and
          assure students are ready for post secondary or career advancement. Education, like everything else, has been
          significantly disrupted since March. We will need to review the impact and followup with action. We need to do
          much more to combat racism, the opportunity gap and making post secondary education affordable. Students are
          our future.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Accessible, affordable health care needs to be further addressed. Last session
          we made progress on prescription drug price transparency and insulin access, but much more needs to be done.

          <br class="hidden lg:inline-block">and what role do businesses play in supporting quality of life issues in
          East Metro communities?
        </h1>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Prior to the pandemic, most area businesses were doing fairly well. Many faced
          challenges though in needing to hire more employees. A key attribute often cited by business is the high
          quality of our schools and workforce. There are numerous partnerships between business and schools, training
          programs with labor, and nonprofits to train or retrain workers. That’s significantly positive.

        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Issues regarding the need to improve infrastructure (particularly
          transportation), regulations and taxes (at various government levels) are raised depending on the business.
          Proposals to address specific concerns are discussed and action usually taken based on bipartisan agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Businesses play a very important role in our area’s quality of life. They
          provide jobs and opportunities, revenue which is distributed for schools and other services, plus
          philanthropy. Together, we accomplish more.</p>

          should have in attracting and retaining jobs,
          <br class="hidden lg:inline-block">and what steps would you take to solicit new businesses to and retain
          existing businesses in the East Metro?
        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Attracting and retaining jobs are crucial for our communities and state. It’s
          imperative that the legislature, Governor and applicable agencies have constructive ongoing conversations and
          partnerships to address jobs. DEED has many programs to assist start-up and existing business. Opportunities
          are available for technical and financial assistance, workforce development and tax incentives. All area post
          secondary schools have partnerships with businesses to address job and training needs.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">I support existing partnership efforts. I welcome and appreciate any additional
          suggestions. I frequently get input and recommendations from businesses when I attend local chamber meetings.
          I followup as needed, have sponsored several chamber bipartisan proposals and earned awards/recognition for
          these efforts.</p>
