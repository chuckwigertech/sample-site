          Senator Charles W. Wiger</h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          I grew up in North St. Paul. So did my parents, George and Helen. I graduated from North High, Hamline
          University (JD, BA) and the University of Colorado, Boulder, Institute for Organization Management.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          I’m an attorney and recently retired from Securian (law/compliance). I previously worked in government affairs
          for the St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce, and also managed several east metro community chambers. Prior to
          that, I had a variety of very interesting jobs: dishwasher, custodian, parked cars, waiter, traveled with the
          circus, clubhouse assistant for Doc Lenz and Ray Crump/Minnesota Twins , reporter, orderly, deckhand on ship
          and lobbyist.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          I have been actively involved in public service and community for most of my adult life. I was first elected
          to the District 622 North Saint Paul-Maplewood-Oakdale School Board when I was 21. For three decades, I was
          elected and re-elected seven times and completed my final three years as chair. I was also elected twice as a
          Supervisor on the Ramsey County Soil and Water Conservation District Board. From 1983 to 1989, I served as a
          member of the Metropolitan Council representing suburban Ramsey, Washington, and Hennepin counties.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          As a state senator, I chaired the education policy and finance committees, and the election committee, plus
          the senate legislative delegations for Ramsey and Washington Counties, and St. Paul. I work hard and
          thoughtfully. I have earned numerous Legislator of the Year awards and recognition from groups representing
          our schools, the environment, social justice, labor, business and health care.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">I live in Maplewood and have five children: Jessica, Charlie, Angelina, Brittany
          and Carolyn and five grandchildren: Mason, Avery, Zachary, Adrianna and Luca. I coached youth sports for over
          25 years, served on the parish council and numerous community boards and committees. In my spare time, I enjoy
          family, playing scrabble and the outdoors.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Recognizing the ongoing impact of COVID-19, my top priority is reopening and
          economic recovery. Jobs, education and health care are three crucial areas, as well as our environment.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Legislators need to actively listen to business, labor, education, nonprofits
          and other stakeholders as we navigate through the pandemic. By listening, we learn, and then we need to lead
          and take action that reflects recommendations. Working together.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">In education, our goal for E-12 is to graduate the “World’s Best Workforce” and
          assure students are ready for post secondary or career advancement. Education, like everything else, has been
          significantly disrupted since March. We will need to review the impact and followup with action. We need to do
          much more to combat racism, the opportunity gap and making post secondary education affordable. Students are
          our future.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Accessible, affordable health care needs to be further addressed. Last session
          we made progress on prescription drug price transparency and insulin access, but much more needs to be done.

        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">How would you characterize the
          business climate in the East Metro
          <br class="hidden lg:inline-block">and what role do businesses play in supporting quality of life issues in
          East Metro communities?
        </h1>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Prior to the pandemic, most area businesses were doing fairly well. Many faced
          challenges though in needing to hire more employees. A key attribute often cited by business is the high
          quality of our schools and workforce. There are numerous partnerships between business and schools, training
          programs with labor, and nonprofits to train or retrain workers. That’s significantly positive.

        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Issues regarding the need to improve infrastructure (particularly
          transportation), regulations and taxes (at various government levels) are raised depending on the business.
          Proposals to address specific concerns are discussed and action usually taken based on bipartisan agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Businesses play a very important role in our area’s quality of life. They
          provide jobs and opportunities, revenue which is distributed for schools and other services, plus
          philanthropy. Together, we accomplish more.</p>

          should have in attracting and retaining jobs,
          <br class="hidden lg:inline-block">and what steps would you take to solicit new businesses to and retain
          existing businesses in the East Metro?
        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Attracting and retaining jobs are crucial for our communities and state. It’s
          imperative that the legislature, Governor and applicable agencies have constructive ongoing conversations and
          partnerships to address jobs. DEED has many programs to assist start-up and existing business. Opportunities
          are available for technical and financial assistance, workforce development and tax incentives. All area post
          secondary schools have partnerships with businesses to address job and training needs.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">I support existing partnership efforts. I welcome and appreciate any additional
          suggestions. I frequently get input and recommendations from businesses when I attend local chamber meetings.
          I followup as needed, have sponsored several chamber bipartisan proposals and earned awards/recognition for
          these efforts.</p>
